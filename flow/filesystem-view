I can do this in one of two ways

1) Parsing on the Client
	-Would need to save to indexed db
	-some buffers will be more than available memory
2) Parsing on Server and Requesting Single files at a time
	-Would need to do custom things with the incoming stream
	-Would save the filesystem to the object
3) Can also simply just push up to github and Identify that particular filesystem as theirs
	-pull changes to help request branch
	-


Need to start visualizing the data
